# Predator/prey "Swarm Levels Problem" research project simulation. 
(Note that this code is here for demonstration, but is unlikely to compile immediately without extensive tweaking and updating.)
In summary, the objective is to establish a relationship between "low-level" rules governing clusters of agents and "high-level" rules governing more abstracted representations of those clusters. 
Rules are represented as sequential condition checks which when activated cause particular actions. 
The simulation consists of agents (predator and prey) and goals (prey tries to reach its goal, predators try to keep prey from their goal and push into the "antigoal" where they are destroyed).
